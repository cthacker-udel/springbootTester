### Sprint Boot Server - Testing via Retrofit2 Interface \(*coded and executed in IntelliJ*\)

**This program is configurable to your custom local Spring Boot server! Runs entirely via command line input!**

---

All that is required is :

* Configure requests @ interface file with GET and POST requests
* Implement new methods to format the data you are sending to the server in the main class
* Edit the menu that displays
* Run the program and test your local server! Examples of a Spring Boot server are located in this repository [here](https://github.com/cthacker-udel/Springboot-MongoDB-Server)
